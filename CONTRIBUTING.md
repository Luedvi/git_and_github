[Setting guidelines for repository contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)

# About contributing guideline
To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file.
The link to the contributing guidelines also appears on your repository's contribute page.

- For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.
- For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.
- For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.
- Repository maintainers can set specific guidelines for issues by creating an issue or pull request template for the repository

# Adding a CONTRIBUTING file
-To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's root directory, type CONTRIBUTING.
-To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's docs directory, type docs/ to create the new directory, then CONTRIBUTING.
- If a repository contains more than one CONTRIBUTING file, then the file shown in links is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory.

# In the new file, add contribution guidelines. These could include:
- Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
- Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
- Community and behavioral expectations.
