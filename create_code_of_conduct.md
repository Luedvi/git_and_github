# [Code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)
Facilitate healthy and constructive community behavior by adopting and enforcing a code of conduct.

## Why do I need a code of conduct?
A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your projectâ€™s participants.
Adopting, and enforcing, a code of conduct can help create a positive social atmosphere for your community.

## Establishing a code of conduct
Try to establish a code of conduct as early as possible, ideally, when you first create your project.

## Deciding how youâ€™ll enforce your code of conduct
A code of conduct that isnâ€™t (or canâ€™t be) enforced is worse than no code of conduct at all: it sends the message that the
values in the code of conductarenâ€™t actually important or respected in your community.

## Enforcing your code of conduct
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, somebody will do something that violates this code. There are several ways to address negative or harmful behavior when it comes up.

## Your responsibilities as a maintainer
A code of conduct is not a law that is enforced arbitrarily. You are the enforcer of the code of conduct and itâ€™s your
responsibility to follow the rules that the code of conduct establishes.

## Encourage the behavior you want to see in the world ðŸŒŽ
When a project seems hostile or unwelcoming, even if itâ€™s just one person whose behavior is tolerated by others, you risk losing many more contributors,
some of whom you may never even meet. Itâ€™s not always easy to adopt or enforce a code of conduct, but fostering a welcoming environment will help your community grow.
