# About security policies
To give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project, you can add a SECURITY.md file to your repository's root, docs, or .github folder. Adding this file to this part(s) of your repository automatically creates a row with a description
where people can review it. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy. To help people find your security policy, you can link to your SECURITY.md file from other places in your repository, such as your
README file. After someone reports a security vulnerability in your project, you can use GitHub Security Advisories to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability.

## Adding a security policy to your repository
- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under the repository name, click  Security. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the  dropdown menu, and then click Security.
- In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click  Policy.
- Click Start setup.
- In the new SECURITY.md file, add information about supported versions of your project and how to report a vulnerability.
- Click Commit changes.

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

declined, etc.
