# [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)

A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code, so it's important to make an informed decision.

You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.
If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license
If you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, according to the Terms of Service, other users of GitHub.com have the right to view and fork your repository. If you have already created a repository and no longer want users to have access to the
repository, you can make the repository private.

Most people place their license text in a file named LICENSE.txt (or LICENSE.md or LICENSE.rst) in the root of the repository.
Some projects include information about their license in their README. For example, a project's README may include a note saying "This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license."
To have your license detected, simplify your LICENSE file and note the complexity somewhere else, such as your repository's README file.

## Including an open source license in your repository
- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Above the list of files, select the Add file  dropdown menu, then click  Create new file. Alternatively, you can click  in the file tree view on the left.
- In the file name field, type LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
- Under the file name, click Choose a license template.
- On the left side of the page, under "Add a license to your project," review the available licenses, then select a license from the list.
- Click Review and submit.
- Click Commit changes...
