# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

# [Code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)
Facilitate healthy and constructive community behavior by adopting and enforcing a code of conduct.

## Why do I need a code of conduct?
A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your projectâ€™s participants.
Adopting, and enforcing, a code of conduct can help create a positive social atmosphere for your community.

## Establishing a code of conduct
Try to establish a code of conduct as early as possible, ideally, when you first create your project.

## Deciding how youâ€™ll enforce your code of conduct
A code of conduct that isnâ€™t (or canâ€™t be) enforced is worse than no code of conduct at all: it sends the message that the
values in the code of conductarenâ€™t actually important or respected in your community.

## Enforcing your code of conduct
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, somebody will do something that violates this code. There are several ways to address negative or harmful behavior when it comes up.

## Your responsibilities as a maintainer
A code of conduct is not a law that is enforced arbitrarily. You are the enforcer of the code of conduct and itâ€™s your
responsibility to follow the rules that the code of conduct establishes.

## Encourage the behavior you want to see in the world ðŸŒŽ
When a project seems hostile or unwelcoming, even if itâ€™s just one person whose behavior is tolerated by others, you risk losing many more contributors,
some of whom you may never even meet. Itâ€™s not always easy to adopt or enforce a code of conduct, but fostering a welcoming environment will help your community grow.
